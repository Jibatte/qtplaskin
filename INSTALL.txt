This code depends on many libraries to work they are all open-source libraries
that can be downloded for free.

LINUX
-----

If you are using Ubuntu or Debian, you can install all the required libraries
with

sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-h5py python-qt4 python-matplotlib


MAC OS X
--------

The recommended way to run QtPlaskin in a Mac OS X computer is to install the
requred libraries with Mac Ports.  You have to

1. Download the version of Mac Ports for your Mac OS X version from
   www.macports.org and install it in your computer.  Instalation takes
   a few minutes.

2. In a terminal, write

  sudo port install python27 py27-matplotlib py27-scipy py27-numpy py27-pyqt4 py27-h5py

  This would install Python 2.7 and all the requred libraries for QtPlaskin.
  Since all the libraries have to be compiled in your system, it may take a
  very long time to complete (about 6-7 hours).

  After that you may want to select version 2.7 as the default python:
  
  sudo port select python python27


WINDOWS
-------

QtPlaskin works also under windows but it has not been throughly tested.
You need to install the dependencies by hand.  This sofware needs to be installed (in brackets we provide the version that has been succesfully tested; others may work too):

* Python [2.7]
* Numpy [1.5.1]
* SciPy [0.9.0]
* matplotlib [1.0.1]
* PyQt4 [binary installer, 4.8.4.1-1]
* h5py [1.3.1]
