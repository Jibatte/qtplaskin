QtPlaskin is a graphical interface to analyze results from a plasma 
kinetic code such as ZdPlasKin (1).  It supports both a specific data
format based on HDF5 and importing directories with certain filesets
that can be written from a running FORTRAN code.

Currently, QtPlaskin runs in Linux, Mac OS X and Windows but see the
file INSTALL.txt for information on the libraries that must be
installed in your system and how to obtain them.
